## Quick Start
1. Create your own card by subclassing `MGSwipeCard`.

    ```swift
    class SampleCard: MGSwipeCard {

	     var model: SampleCardModel? {
	         didSet {
	             configureModel()
	         }
	     }
	     
	     func configureModel() {
	         guard let model = model else { return }
	         self.setBackgroundImage(model.image)
	     }
    
    }
    
    struct SampleCardModel {
	     var image: UIImage
    }
    ```

2. Add a `MGCardStackView` to your view and implement to the protocol `MGCardStackViewDataSource`.

    ```swift
    class ViewController: UIViewController {
    
        var cards = [MyMGSwipeCard]()
        
        override func viewDidLoad() {
            super.viewDidLoad()
            
            let cardStack = MGCardStackView()
            view.addSubview(cardStack)
            cardStack.frame = view.safeAreaLayoutGuide.bounds.insetBy(dx: 10, dy: 50)
            cardStack.dataSource = self
            
            for model in cardModels {
                let card = MyMGSwipeCard()
                card.model = model
                cards.append(card)
            }
        }
        
    }

    //MARK: - Data Source Methods
	
        extension ViewController: MGCardStackViewDataSource {

	    func numberOfCards() -> Int {
		    return cards.count
        }
        
	    func card(forItemAtIndex index: Int) -> MGSwipeCard {
		    return cards[index]
	    }
	
    }

    //MARK: - Card Models

    extension ViewController {

	    var cardModels: [SampleMGSwipeCardModel] {
            var models = [SampleMGSwipeCardModel]()
        
            let model1 = MyModel(image: UIImage(named: "cardImage1"))
            let model2 = MyModel(image: UIImage(named: "cardImage2"))
            let model3 = MyModel(image: UIImage(named: "cardImage3"))
                
            models.append(model1)
            models.append(model2)
            models.append(model3)
        
            return models
        }
    
    }
    ```
    
3. Happy swiping!


## Useful Methods
The following methods can be accessed from `MGCardStackView`.

### Swipe
Performs a swipe programmatically in the given direction. Any delegate methods are called as usual.

```swift
func swipe(withDirection direction: SwipeDirection)
```

![Shift](Images/swipe.gif)

### Undo
Restores the card stack to its state before the last swipe. Returns the newly restored card.

```swift
func undoLastSwipe() -> MGSwipeCard?
```

![Shift](Images/undo.gif)

### Shift
Shifts the card stack's cards by the given distance. Any previously swiped cards are skipped over.

```swift
func shift(withDistance distance: Int = 1)
```

![Shift](Images/shift.gif)

## Customization
Each `MGSwipeCard` has the following built-in UI properties. Other subviews can be added to make your own unique card template.

### Background image
The background image can be set with 

```swift 
func setBackgroundImage(_ image: UIImage)
```

### Footer
The footer can be set with 

```swift 
func setFooterView(_ footer: UIView?)
```
The footer's height should be modified with `footerHeight`. The card's background image is displayed above the footer unless the footer is transparent.

### Overlays
An *overlay* is the view whose alpha value reacts to the user's dragging. The card's overlays can be set with

```swift 
func setOverlay(forDirection direction: SwipeDirection, overlay: UIView?)
```
The overlays will always be laid out above the footer.

### Shadow
The card's shadow can be set with

```swift 
func setShadow(radius: CGFloat, opacity: Float, offset: CGSize, color: UIColor)
```
